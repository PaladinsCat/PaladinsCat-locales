# Weblate to GitHub workflow

Weblate is the primary place to translate PaladinsCat at
[translate.paladinscat.com](https://translate.paladinscat.com). It must use its GitHub
pull-request integration, never direct pushes to `main`.

## Contributor and reviewer flow

1. Open [translate.paladinscat.com](https://translate.paladinscat.com), then
   choose a language and namespace.
2. Submit a translation or suggestion, preserving placeholders exactly.
3. A language reviewer approves the wording in Weblate. The project commit
   policy excludes every string that is not in Weblate's approved state.
4. Weblate's repository-scoped GitHub App commits the approved strings to its
   translation branch and opens or updates a pull request against `main`. It
   cannot push `main`.
5. A maintainer checks the GitHub diff and required validation, then merges.
6. The frontend's hourly locale-pin workflow detects the merged locale commit,
   validates it, compiles the complete frontend, and only then opens a
   protected frontend pull request for the mechanical submodule-pin change.

Weblate review is linguistic QA. GitHub pull-request review and the required
`npm run validate` check remain release authorization.

## Project configuration

- Import `locales/en` as the source language and target files under
  `locales/<locale>`; keep namespace paths intact.
- The self-hosted Weblate GitHub App is connected to the PaladinsCat workspace
  and installed only for `PaladinsCat-locales`. Its app webhook updates Weblate
  after merged source changes.
- Reviews are enabled and the project quality policy is **Only include approved
  translations**. Reviewers use a project-scoped role; contributors cannot
  approve their own wording by virtue of translation access.
- Restrict Weblate registration and assign language-review permissions to
  trusted reviewers.
- Do not store the bot token in this repository, locale files, or the frontend.

The governed platform sync script remains a recovery path. It refuses to run
unless approval-only commits are enabled and exports committed `HEAD`, never
Weblate's mutable working tree.

## Source updates and conflicts

Application changes update canonical English in a normal pull request. After
merge, Weblate pulls the source change through its webhook or scheduled sync.
Resolve any Weblate Git conflict before creating a translation pull request;
do not overwrite changed English keys from Weblate.
